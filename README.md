# Clutter

Clutter is a drag-and-drop canvas for cloud architecture. You draw a diagram (a Lambda, an S3 bucket, an EC2 server, with lines between them), and Clutter turns it into Terraform and Ansible and runs it inside your own cloud account.

It began as a University of Calgary capstone (team 500-MM-3, 2025 to 2026) for Alberta 2514640 Inc. That version works with AWS only. A previous capstone team built that version; we are the new team, extending it so a diagram can deploy to other targets, such as PatriCloud and TierHive, through an adapter layer.

This page gets you from a fresh clone to a working setup, and shows where everything lives. Read it once, top to bottom.

## Where the project stands

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **System A** (Clutter as built, AWS only) | Complete and tested by the capstone team. Its AWS deployment has been torn down. It runs locally through `backend/devserver`, except the parts that need AWS (generate, deploy, logs, Ansible). |
| **System B** (the adapter layer) | Designed, not built. Phase 0 (security fixes A and B share) comes first. |
| **Local checks** | Go build, frontend type-check, lint and build, Terraform validate and the database schema all pass. Two Go test packages fail (known). |
| **Open defects** | Several security defects in A, some critical. Listed in `.claude/findings/NOW.md`. Read that before you build on any A code path. |

## The two systems

**A: Clutter today.** A Next.js canvas, 33 Go Lambdas (31 API routes, an authorizer and a queue consumer) behind AWS API Gateway, Postgres on Supabase, S3, and two Fargate runners: one runs Terraform in the customer's AWS account, one runs Ansible on the customer's EC2 servers over SSM. Full description: `docs/architecture/system-a-as-built.md`.

**B: the adapter layer.** New code beside A, not a rewrite of A. B has its own API, a connector interface, and one connector per target: General (custom) first, then PatriCloud and TierHive. Full design: `docs/architecture/system-b-adapter-layer.md`. The team's original figures are in `docs/architecture/system-b-team-plan/`.

The names everyone uses:

| Name | Means |
| --- | --- |
| C | the whole Clutter app (A and B together) |
| A | Clutter as built (AWS). We change it only at four named seams. |
| B | the adapter layer we are building |
| B1 | B as a service anyone can run, with entity connectors (built first) |
| B2 | B run inside a company, with instance connectors (later) |
| connector | the code for one target type (General, PatriCloud, TierHive). An *entity connector* is one we write for a target type (B1); an *instance connector* is one a company builds for its own setup (B2). |
| PatriCloud | our working name for Patrii Cloud (patrii.cloud), a Canadian cloud; the same thing |
| General | the first connector: Terraform with any provider the customer names, or servers they already have over SSH (the exact scope is open question 1 in `NOW.md`) |
| instance | one company's configured setup of a connector |
| seam | one of the four places B touches A: the target choice screen, shared sign-in, the shared database, and security fixes |
| phase 0 | the first work item: security fixes on the parts A and B share (listed in `.claude/findings/NOW.md`) |
| ADR | architecture decision record: one entry in `docs/decisions.md` |

The full definitions are in `docs/architecture/system-b-adapter-layer.md` § Names. AWS terms you will meet in A: Lambda (a function AWS runs on request), API Gateway (AWS's HTTP front door), Fargate (AWS running a container on demand), STS (AWS issuing short-lived credentials for another account's role), SSM (AWS running a command on a server without SSH), S3 (file storage), SQS (a queue). The Supabase webhook is a trigger configured in the database service, outside this repo.

There are two kinds of Terraform here. `backend/infra` deploys Clutter itself. The `*.tf.tmpl` files are templates the generator fills in for a customer. They never stand in for each other.

## Set up

### 1. Install

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (tested) or Linux; Windows only through WSL (untested) | | |
| Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) | any recent | everything |
| Go | 1.25 or newer | the backend |
| Node.js with npm | 22 or newer | the frontend (use npm; `pnpm-lock.yaml` is stale) |
| Terraform | 1.x | checking the infrastructure code |
| Docker (running) | any recent | the local database |
| curl, openssl, python3 | macOS has them | the local run scripts |
| AWS CLI | v2 | only for deploying, which nobody does from a laptop yet |
| Claude Code, and `jq` | optional | the AI setup in `.claude/` (its hooks need `jq`: `brew install jq`) |

### 2. Clone

Our working repo is a fork. The client's original is `upstream`; never push to it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FayzanT/re-clutter
cd re-clutter
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Alberta2514640/clutter
npm --prefix frontend/clutter ci
```

The clone's `origin` is our fork; `upstream` is the client's repo, for reading only.

### 3. Check that everything builds

Run from the repo root.

```bash
go -C backend/api build ./...
go -C backend/api vet ./...
go -C backend/api test ./...          # 2 packages fail today (one waits about 70 s first); see below
npx --prefix frontend/clutter tsc --noEmit -p frontend/clutter
npm --prefix frontend/clutter run lint
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9999 npm --prefix frontend/clutter run build
terraform -chdir=backend/infra fmt -check -recursive    # 7 files fail today
go -C backend/devserver test ./...     # the local run tool
```

The two failing test packages are known: `terraform-engine/create` needs live S3 (it waits about 70 seconds, then fails), and `tests/generic` panics on a nil database connection. Every other package must pass. The expected result of each check is kept in `backend/README.md` and `frontend/clutter/README.md`.

### 4. Run the app locally

The first run takes a minute or two while it builds the 33 Lambdas. Start the database and backend (`run.sh` starts them in the background and returns):

```bash
backend/devserver/run.sh                     # Postgres, then A's real Lambdas behind a local API Gateway
```

Then the frontend, which keeps running in its terminal. It uses port 3100 because the devserver's front door holds 3000:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8787 npm --prefix frontend/clutter run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3100
```

Then:

1. Open <http://localhost:3000/dev/login>. It signs you in as a local dev user. (Port 3000 is the devserver's front door; it passes pages through to the frontend on 3100.)
2. The first time, the database is empty. Create an organization at <http://localhost:3000/onboarding/create-org>, then a project from the dashboard.
3. The diagram editor stays locked until the organization has a linked AWS account. Link a fake one (it only writes to the local database):

   ```bash
   backend/devserver/link-fake-account.sh
   ```

4. Open a diagram and use the canvas. Deploy will fail at its AWS call; that is expected.

Other commands:

```bash
backend/devserver/smoke.sh                   # calls all 31 routes and prints what passed
backend/devserver/stop.sh                    # stops everything; add --wipe to delete the local database
```

Organizations, projects, diagrams, the canvas and the resource palette work locally. Generating Terraform, deploying, logs and Ansible only work in AWS. The full table is in `backend/devserver/README.md`.

Other ways to run it (a production build of the frontend, the Docker image, `docker-compose.yml`) and whether each works are in `frontend/clutter/README.md`. There is no npm or pnpm command for the backend: the Go code runs as Lambdas, locally through `backend/devserver`.

### 5. Optional: look at the UI without the backend

Stop the devserver first (`backend/devserver/stop.sh`); both use port 3000.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9999 npm --prefix frontend/clutter run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The home page and `/login` render. You cannot sign in this way; use step 4.

### 6. Optional: load the database by hand

`run.sh` does this for you. To do it by hand:

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name clutter-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=local -e POSTGRES_DB=clutter postgres:17-alpine
until docker exec clutter-pg pg_isready -U postgres -d clutter; do sleep 1; done
docker exec clutter-pg psql -U postgres -d clutter -c "create role anon; create role authenticated; create role service_role;"
docker exec -i clutter-pg psql -U postgres -d clutter < backend/storage-sql/application-tables.sql
docker exec -i clutter-pg psql -U postgres -d clutter < backend/storage-sql/seed-resources.sql
docker exec clutter-pg psql -U postgres -d clutter -c "\dt"
docker stop clutter-pg
```

You should see 11 tables. The roles exist because the schema was written for Supabase.

## What only works in AWS

The Go code was built to run as AWS Lambdas; `backend/devserver` runs it locally, but anything that calls S3, ECS or SQS stops there. The capstone deployment is gone, and its AWS account is not ours. Running Clutter fully, including deploys, needs our own AWS account, a Postgres or Supabase database, a Google sign-in client, and a set of secrets. No extra tools are needed. The nine steps, and what must be fixed first, are in `docs/architecture/system-a-as-built.md` § Deploying to AWS.

### Do not run

- `frontend/clutter/init.bash`. It is an old scaffold script that overwrites real source files.
- `terraform plan` or `apply` in `backend/infra`. Its state backend is the capstone team's AWS account.

## Your first day

Read in this order:

1. This page.
2. `docs/architecture/system-a-as-built.md`: what A does, what the capstone delivered, and where the final report is wrong about the code.
3. `docs/architecture/system-b-adapter-layer.md`: what we are building and in what order.
4. `.claude/findings/NOW.md`: what is in progress, the open defects, the open questions.
5. `docs/decisions.md`: why things are the way they are.
6. `CLAUDE.md`: skim it. It is written for AI agents, but its "What you will get wrong" list is the fastest way to learn the traps.

Then pick a task from `NOW.md` § Next. Tell the team which one you are taking, so two people do not take the same one. A good first task is the last phase 0 item (make the Go tests pass offline): it is small, it touches no security path, and it teaches you the backend and its tests.

## How we work

- **Branches.** Branch off `main`. Never commit to `main` directly, open pull requests against our fork (`origin`), and never push to `upstream`.
- **Taking a task.** The tasks are the tables in `.claude/findings/NOW.md` § Next. Put your name in a task's Owner cell in your branch's first commit and open a draft pull request at once, so two people never take the same task. The rules for editing `NOW.md` without merge conflicts are at the top of that section.
- **Before you open a pull request:**
  1. The checks in step 3 pass (the same ones run in GitHub on every pull request: `.github/workflows/checks.yml`).
  2. If you touched `backend/`, `backend/devserver/run.sh` then `smoke.sh` still shows 0 fail.
  3. Docs whose facts you changed are updated (`docs/README.md` says which file owns which fact).
  4. A decision you made is in `docs/decisions.md`.
- **Decisions.** An ADR starts as "proposed" and becomes "accepted" when its pull request is approved by the team (and the client, for scope or hosting). Write it before the change it decides.
- **Commits.** Say what changed and why. One commit per finished change, after the checks pass.
- **Changing A.** A changes only at the four seams. Any other change to A is a decision: write it in `docs/decisions.md` first.
- **Security rules.** Every handler that takes an id checks that the caller belongs to the organization and that the thing belongs to that organization. No value from the canvas reaches generated code without validation or escaping. Credentials and Terraform state never go in logs, responses or docs.
- **Docs.** Each fact has one owner doc (`docs/README.md` has the map). When code changes a fact, update its owner in the same pull request. When a doc and the code disagree, the code wins and the doc gets fixed.
- **Adding a cloud resource.** Follow `.claude/skills/add-cloud-resource/SKILL.md`, even without Claude Code. It lists every place a resource is defined.
- **One devserver per machine.** Its ports and database are fixed, so two clones on one laptop share them; separate laptops never collide.

### Claude Code

The `.claude/` folder sets up Claude Code for this repo. You do not need it, but if you use it:

- `CLAUDE.md` is read at the start of every session; folder `CLAUDE.md` files load when Claude works in that folder.
- Agents: `reader` (reads and reports), `researcher` (outside facts with sources), `executor` (builds a planned change), `red-pill-reviewer` (tries to break finished work).
- Skills: `engineering-conventions`, `add-cloud-resource`, `ground-before-building`, `lane-doctrine`.
- Hooks block reading secrets, ask before any deploy or cloud write, keep git read-only for helper agents, and format Go and Terraform on save without reformatting A's untouched files.
- What each file in `.claude/` does: `.claude/README.md`.
